# SQL-Tutorial

In this SQL tutorial, youâ€™ll learn all the basic to advanced SQL concepts like SQL queries, SQL join, SQL injection, SQL insert, and creating tables in SQL. SQL is easy to learn, there are no prerequisites to learning SQL.

So, SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.

## Why to Learn SQL?
SQL helps you to easily get information from data with high efficiency. To manipulate the data in databases like Create, Read, Edit, and Delete, we use SQL queries. Users can interact with data stored in relational database management systems. Anyone who knows the English language can easily write SQL queries. Some of the key features of SQL are given below:
- Without a lot of coding knowledge, we can manage a database with SQL.
- SQL works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, etc.
- Simple and easy to learn.
- SQL is an ANSI and ISO standard language for database manipulation.
- SQL retrieves large amounts of data very fast.

## Pre-Requisites to Learn SQL
If you want to learn SQL then, this free SQL tutorial is quite easy to understand because, during the development of this course, we tried our best to provide the best resource to clear your SQL concept.

But we assume that you are already aware of the basic conceptions of computer science, like databases and its types.

So, if you have basic knowledge of RDBMS, then this SQL tutorial provides you with enough knowledge to master SQL.

## Important Commands

Here is the list of some important SQL Commands:

| Command                | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SELECT                 | Used to retrieve data from a database.                   |
| INSERT                 | Adds new records or rows to a table.                     |
| UPDATE                 | Modifies existing records in a table.                    |
| DELETE                 | Removes records from a table.                            |
| CREATE TABLE           | Creates a new table in the database.                     |
| ALTER TABLE            | Modifies an existing table structure.                    |
| DROP TABLE             | Deletes a table from the database.                       |
| CREATE INDEX           | Creates an index on a table column to speed up data retrieval. |
| DROP INDEX             | Removes an index from a table.                           |
| CREATE VIEW            | Creates a virtual table based on the result of a SQL statement. |
| DROP VIEW              | Deletes a view from the database.                        |
| INSERT INTO SELECT     | Inserts data from one table into another based on a query. |
| TRUNCATE TABLE         | Removes all records from a table, but keeps the table structure intact. |
| ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT | Adds a constraint to a table after it has been created. |
| GRANT                  | Gives specific privileges to database users.              |
| REVOKE                 | Removes specific privileges from database users.         |
| COMMIT                 | Saves all changes made since the last commit.            |
| ROLLBACK               | Discards all changes made since the last commit.         |
| BEGIN TRANSACTION      | Starts a new transaction.                                |
| SET TRANSACTION        | Sets characteristics for the transaction.                |

## Applications of SQL
In data-driven industries where managing databases is very important in regular, Here are some important SQL applications.
- To support client/server architecture, software engineers use SQL to establish the connection between the back-end and front-end.
- SQL can also be used in the 3-tier architecture of a client, an application server, and a database.
- SQL is used as a Data Definition Language(DDL) in which we can independently create a database, define the structure, use it, and discard it when its work is done.
- SQL is used as a Data Manipulation Language(DML) in which we can enter data, modify data, and extract data.
- SQL is used as a Data Control Language(DCL) it specifies how we can protect our database against corruption and misuse.
