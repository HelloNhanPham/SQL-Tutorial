SQL Hosting is nothing but a means to manage any RDBMS linked to your website using SQL. If the website has an access to a RDBMS, any data from the website you created will be stored and retrieved from this database.

There are various SQL hosting plans available if your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
