# PERFORMANCE TUNING

**SQL Performance tuning** is the process of enhancing SQL queries to speed up the server performance. Performance tuning in SQL shortens the time it takes for a user to receive a response after sending a query and utilizes fewer resources in the process. The idea is that users can occasionally produce the same intended result set with a faster-running query.
