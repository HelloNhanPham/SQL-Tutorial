    "\n",
    "<p>Web servers communicate with database servers anytime they need to retrieve or store user data. SQL statements by the attacker are designed so that they can be executed while the web server is fetching content from the application server.</p>\n",

    "<p><strong>SQL in Web Pages</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>SQL injection typically occurs when you ask a user for input, such as their username/user ID, and instead of their name/ID, the user inputs an SQL statement that will be executed without the knowledge about your database.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>There are different types of SQL injection attacks:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>1. In-band SQL Injection</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It involves sending malicious SQL queries directly through the web application’s interface and allows attackers to extract sensitive information or modify the database itself.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>2. Error-based SQL Injection</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Attackers exploit error messages generated by the web application by analyzing error messages to gain access to confidential data or modify the database.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>3. Blind SQL Injection</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Attackers send malicious SQL queries and observe the application’s response. By analyzing the application’s behavior, attackers can determine the success of the query.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>4. Out-of-band SQL Injection</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Uses a different channel to communicate with the database. Allows attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data from the database.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>5. Inference-based SQL Injection</strong></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Uses statistical inference to gain access to confidential data. Attackers create queries that return the same result regardless of input values.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <span style='color: #A0522D'><strong>Impact of SQL Injection</strong></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The hacker can retrieve all the user data present in the database such as user details, credit card information, and social security numbers, and can also gain access to protected areas like the administrator portal. It is also possible to delete user data from the tables.</p>\n",
