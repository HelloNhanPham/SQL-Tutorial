SQL injection is a code injection technique attackers use to gain unauthorized access to a database by injecting malicious SQL commands into web page inputs.

Attackers can extract sensitive information, modify database data, execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

In this article, we will discuss what is SQLi(SQL Injection), Types of SQL injection, SQL injection in web pages, how to prevent SQL injection attacks, and many more.
