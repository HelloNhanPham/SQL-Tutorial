# Introduce
The SQL NOT NULL forces particular values or records should not to hold a null value. It is somewhat similar to the primary key condition as the primary key canâ€™t have null values in the table although both are completely different things.

In SQL, constraints are some set of rules that are applied to the data type of the specified table, Or we can say that using constraints we can apply limits on the type of data that can be stored in the particular column of the table.

Constraints are typically placed specified along with CREATE statement. By default, a column can hold null values.
