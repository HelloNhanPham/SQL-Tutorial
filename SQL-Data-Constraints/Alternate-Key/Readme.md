Keys are an important part of any Relational Database. There are various types of keys and among one of these is the Alternate Key. The keys that contain all the properties needed to become a Candidate Key are known as Alternate Keys. These are basically secondary Candidate Keys that can uniquely identify a row in a table. So, Alternate Keys are also sometimes known as “Secondary Keys”.

In other words, we can define the Alternate key as the set of Candidate Keys other than the Primary Key. There can be many Candidate Keys for a given table and out of all these the Database Administrators selects only one of these as the Primary Key. Hence, the other Candidate Keys which are not used as a Primary Key are the “Alternate Keys”.
