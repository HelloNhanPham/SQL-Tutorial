In SQL Server, indexing plays a crucial role in enhancing data retrieval efficiency. Indexes are disk-based structures linked to tables or views, aiding in quicker row retrieval by organizing data in a structured manner. Two primary types of indexes in SQL Server are Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes.

An index is a disk-based structure linked to a table or view that facilitates quicker row retrieval. A table or view’s table or view’s columns are used to create keys in an index. These keys are kept in a structure (B-tree) that enables SQL Server to quickly and effectively locate the row or rows that correspond to the key values.
