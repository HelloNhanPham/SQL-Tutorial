SQL statistical functions are essential tools for extracting meaningful insights from databases. These functions, such as AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), STDDEV(), and VAR(), enable users to perform statistical calculations on numeric data. Whether determining averages, sums, counts, or measures of variability, these functions empower efficient data analysis within the SQL environment.
