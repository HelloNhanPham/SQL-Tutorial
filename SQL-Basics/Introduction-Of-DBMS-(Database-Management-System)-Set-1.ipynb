    "    <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.</p>\n",
    "    <p>DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in convenient and efficient manner.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Key Features of DBMS</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>Data modeling</b>: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>Data storage and retrieval</b>: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>Concurrency control</b>: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>Data integrity and security</b>: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>Backup and recovery</b>: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>DBMS can be classified into two types</b>: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>RDBMS</b>: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.</p>\n",
    "    <p>+ <b>NoSQL</b>: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.</p>\n",
    "    <p>A database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from it.</p>\n",

    "    <p>File System manages data using files on a hard disk. Users are allowed to create, delete, and update the files according to their requirements. Let us consider the example of file-based University Management System. Data of students is available to their respective Departments, Academics Section, Result Section, Accounts Section, Hostel Office, etc. Some of the data is common for all sections like Roll No, Name, Father Name, Address, and Phone number of students but some data is available to a particular section only like Hostel allotment number which is a part of the hostel office. Let us discuss the issues with this system:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ <p><b>Redundancy of data</b>: Data is said to be redundant if the same data is copied at many places. If a student wants to change their Phone number, he or she has to get it updated in various sections. Similarly, old records must be deleted from all sections representing that student.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Inconsistency of Data</b>: Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of the same data do not match each other. If the Phone number is different in Accounts Section and Academics Section, it will be inconsistent. Inconsistency may be because of typing errors or not updating all copies of the same data.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Difficult Data Access</b>: A user should know the exact location of the file to access data, so the process is very cumbersome and tedious. If the user wants to search the student hostel allotment number of a student from 10000 unsorted students’ records, how difficult it can be.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Unauthorized Access</b>: File Systems may lead to unauthorized access to data. If a student gets access to a file having his marks, he can change it in an unauthorized way.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>No Concurrent Access</b>: The access of the same data by multiple users at the same time is known as concurrency. The file system does not allow concurrency as data can be accessed by only one user at a time.</p>\n",
