    "+ <p><b>Flexibility in Data Models</b>: Unlike rigid table-based structures in relational databases, non-relational databases support flexible data models like document stores (e.g., <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-json/'><b><u>JSON</u></b></a> in MongoDB), <b>key-value pairs</b> (e.g., <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-redis-server/'><b><u>Redis</u></b></a>), and wide-column stores (e.g., Cassandra), making it easier to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Performance</b>: Non-relational databases are optimized for specific use cases such as real-time data ingestion, high-speed <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transaction-in-dbms/'><b><u>transactions</u></b></a>, and rapid access to large volumes of data. They often outperform relational databases in these scenarios due to their distributed architecture and optimized data storage formats.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Schemaless Design</b>: Non-relational databases typically do not enforce a rigid schema, allowing developers to evolve the data structure over time without downtime or complex migrations. This advantage is particularly beneficial in agile development environments and for handling diverse and <b>unpredictable</b> data types.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>High Availability and Fault Tolerance</b>: Many non-relational databases are designed with built-in replication and automatic failover capabilities, ensuring high availability and data redundancy. This makes them suitable for mission-critical applications where continuous uptime is essential.</p>\n",
    "+ <p><b>Cost-Effectiveness</b>: By using commodity hardware and open-source software, non-relational databases often provide a more cost-effective solution compared to traditional relational databases, especially at scale.</p>\n",
