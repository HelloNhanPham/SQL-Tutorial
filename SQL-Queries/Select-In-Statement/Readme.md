# Note
- SQL SELECT IN Statement allows to specify multiple values in the WHERE clause. It is similar to using multiple OR conditions. It is particularly useful for filtering records based on a list of values or the results of a subquery.
- The IN operator compares a value with a set of values, and it returns a TRUE if the value belongs to that given set, else it returns a FALSE.
