# Note
The SQL WITH clause, also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), was introduced by Oracle in the Oracle 9i release 2 database. The SQL WITH clause allows you to give a sub-query block a name (a process also called sub-query refactoring), which can be referenced in several places within the main SQL query.
